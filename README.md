**Presentation on the topics of Support Vector Machines and Graph Convolutional Networks**

This presentation contatins example implementations of classification on the [**Iris Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) with `scikit-learn` and on the [**Cora Dataset**](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cora) with `PyTorch`.

The repository contains both the slides used in the presentation and a Jupiter Notebook containing the code, along with its explanation, in the context of both datasets mentioned here.

The slides go over the theoretical fundamentals of both algorithms, SVM and GCN.
