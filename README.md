**Presentation on the topics of Support Vector Machines and Graph Convolutional Networks**

Support Vector Machines (**SVMs**) and Graph Convolutional Networks (**GCNs**) are relevant in **classification and prediction problems**. 

SVMs are powerful algorithms for binary and multi-class classification, working well in high-dimensional spaces and capturing non-linear decision boundaries using kernel functions. 
SVMs have been used for email spam detection, image classification, text categorization, and financial forecasting.

GCNs specialize in graph-structured data, capturing complex relationships through graph convolution, message passing, and aggregation. GCNs find applications in social network analysis, drug discovery, fraud detection, knowledge graph completion, traffic flow prediction, and recommendation systems. 

Both SVMs and GCNs offer distinct approaches for accurate predictions and understanding complex data patterns.
